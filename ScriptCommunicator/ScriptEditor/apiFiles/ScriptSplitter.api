ScriptSplitter::sizes(void):Array<Number> \nReturns a list of the size parameters of all the widgets in this splitter.\nIf the splitter's orientation is horizontal, the list contains the widgets width in pixels,\nfrom left to right; if the orientation is vertical, the list contains the widgets height in pixels, from top to bottom.
ScriptSplitter::setSizes(Array<Number> list):void \nSets the child widgets respective sizes to the values given in the list.\n the splitter is horizontal, the values set the width of each widget in pixels, from left to right.\nIf the splitter is vertical, the height of each widget is set, from top to bottom.\nExtra values in the list are ignored. If list contains too few values, the result is undefined but the program will still be well-behaved.\nThe overall size of the splitter widget is not affected. Instead, any additional/missing space is distributed amongst the widgets according\nto the relative weight of the sizes.\nIf you specify a size of 0, the widget will be invisible. The size policies of the widgets are preserved.\nThat is, a value smaller then the minimal size hint of the respective widget will be replaced by the value of the hint.
